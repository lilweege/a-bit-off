## Backstory
This game was created as my final project for ICS4U. It was meant to be a group project but I competed it all myself. 

## Features
The game is built using the Java Swing toolkit. There are many classes responsible for the menuing, window, assets, and input, as well as for the engine, rendering, and finally game objects. The input was handled using inheritence, the game loop was created using threading, and the game objects were implemented using inheritence.

## Implementation
The rendering pipeline required threading timing, passing references to parent elements, and manual string parsing. The game loop structure was based on a forum post on math exchange. All game objects are all children of an abstract Game Object.

## Assets
Most assets are images that I found on the internet and modified. \
Songs used in the game are 8-bit remixes of "Tiny Little Adiantum" and "Futsal Shuffle" \
Blip sound effects created using bfxr. \
The font used is "fixedsys".
